## Introduction
This study explores the relationship between family involvement and the academic performance of secondary school students. Various factors such as parental occupation, marital status, family size, and parental education level were analyzed to understand their impact on student performance.

## Data
The dataset used for this study was collected from two Portuguese schools and includes various features like gender, family size, parental cohabitation status, parental education and occupation, family educational support, quality of family relationships, and final grades.

## Methodology
- **Participants**: Secondary school students from two Portuguese schools.
- **Data Collection**: Data was collected from Aman Chauhan (2022) through Kaggle.
- **Analysis**: Four different ANOVAs and chi-square tests were conducted to test the hypothesis that family involvement impacts student performance.

## Key Variables
- **Gender**: M (male) or F (female)
- **Family Size**: LE3 (less or equal to 3) or GT3 (greater than 3)
- **Parental Cohabitation Status**: T (living together) or A (apart)
- **Parental Education**: 0 (none), 1 (primary), 2 (5th to 9th grade), 3 (secondary), 4 (higher education)
- **Parental Occupation**: teacher, health, services, at home, other
- **Family Educational Support**: yes or no
- **Quality of Family Relationships**: 1 (very bad) to 5 (excellent)
- **Final Grade**: 0 to 20

## Results
1. **Parental Marital Status**: No significant effect on student performance.
2. **Parental Occupation**:
   - Mother's occupation significantly impacts student performance.
   - Fathers' occupation does not show a significant impact.
3. **Parental Education**:
   - Higher educational levels in parents are associated with more support for children’s schoolwork.
4. **Family Size**: No significant effect on student performance.

## Discussion
The analysis showed that family involvement, particularly the mother's occupation and parental education level, plays a significant role in student academic success. However, factors like parental marital status and family size did not show a significant impact.

## Conclusion
The study highlights the importance of family involvement, especially the mother’s occupation and parental education level, in influencing student academic performance. It suggests that schools should work closely with families to promote educational support at home.

## Limitations
- The study was limited to student results in math.
- Data was collected from only two Portuguese schools, which may limit generalizability.
- Self-reported measures may introduce bias.

## Future Research
Future studies should explore a broader range of subjects, include more schools, and consider other factors like socioeconomic status and cultural background to provide a comprehensive understanding of family involvement in student success.
